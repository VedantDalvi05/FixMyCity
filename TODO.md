# TODO: Implement Issue Reporting and Tracking Flow

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Update ReportIssue.tsx to submit reports via backend API (POST /api/issues)
- [x] Update MyReports.tsx to fetch user reports from backend API (GET /api/issues/reporter/:reporterId)
- [x] Adjust apiHelpers.ts for proper data conversion (location and areaCode handling)
- [x] Test end-to-end flow: Submit report, verify confirmation, redirect to My Reports, confirm new report appears
