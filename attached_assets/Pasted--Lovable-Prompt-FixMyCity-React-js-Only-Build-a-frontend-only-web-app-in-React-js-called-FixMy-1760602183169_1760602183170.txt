✅ Lovable Prompt — FixMyCity (React.js Only)

Build a frontend-only web app in React.js called FixMyCity with two roles: Citizens and Admins. The app should use ONLY React.js (with React Router), localStorage for storage, and Leaflet for maps.

👤 CITIZEN FEATURES

Users should be able to:

Report civic issues (potholes, garbage, streetlight, drainage, other).

Upload photos from phone gallery (1–3 images).

Add description, category, and location (auto-detect GPS + manual entry).

Submit and receive a unique ticket ID.

Track their own issue statuses (Submitted → In Progress → Resolved).

View ONLY their submitted issues.

🗺️ PUBLIC MAP VIEW (USER SIDE)

Create a map page using Leaflet where:

Each issue appears as a colored dot, based on category:

🔴 Red – Potholes

🟢 Green – Garbage

🟡 Yellow – Streetlight

🔵 Blue – Drainage

🟣 Purple – Other

On clicking a dot, show:

Issue image(s)

Description

Category & status

Address/location
This lets users see what’s happening around their city.

🛠️ ADMIN DASHBOARD (HIGH INFORMATION DENSITY)

The admin view must be data-rich and include:

✅ Overview Stats

Total reports

Pending / In-progress / Resolved

New this week

Average resolution time

✅ Charts & Analytics

Category-wise pie chart

Area/ward-based bar chart

Resolved vs pending graph

Trendline of reports over time

✅ Interactive Map (Admin View)

Same color-coded markers as user map

Click marker → view issue details & images

Optional filtering by category and status

✅ Report Management Table

🔐 AUTHENTICATION (Mock Only)

Use hardcoded credentials:

User: user@demo / password

Admin: admin@demo / admin123

Use client-side route protection only.

💾 DATA & STORAGE

Use localStorage to store reports.

Seed with 8–10 demo issues on first load.

Each report object should include:

{
  id,
  category,
  description,
  photos[],
  location: { lat, lng, address },
  areaCode,
  status,
  severity,
  createdAt,
  updatedAt,
  reporter: { id, name, contact },
  adminNotes: []
}
